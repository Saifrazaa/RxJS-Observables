## RxJS Notes

### Reactive Programming

- Programming paradigm that works with asynchronous data streams
- Data streams can be created from many things,
  - UI Events
  - Http Request
  - File System
  - Array like Objects.

### Stream

- Sequence of ongoing events ordered in time that emits a value, error & completed

### Observables

- Used to watch these streams & emit functions
- Can be subscribed by an observer
- Will constantly watching streams & update accordingly
- Interact with data streams as any regular array

### RX

- Asynchronous program by using observable sequence.
- Provides a list of operators to filter, select, transform, combine & composable observables
